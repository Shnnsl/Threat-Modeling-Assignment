# Threat-Modeling-Assignment
This repository contains the materials for my Threat Modeling Assignment, including an Initial Threat Model created with OWASP Threat Dragon. The project models a simple web application with user login, message-of-the-day functionality, and comment submissions. The repository will store the threat model files and related documentation.
